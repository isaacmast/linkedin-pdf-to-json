# linkedin-pdf-to-json

linkedin-pdf-to-json is a JavaScript recursive descent parser Node.js command line tool for storing text retrieved from LinkedIn profile PDFs in a JSON object and storing it in a file or printing it to the console.

## Installation

### Global install

```
npm install -g linkedin-pdf-to-json
```

Global installation will create the `lptj` command and add it to your `/usr/local/bin/` directory for use outside of your project directory.

### Local install

```
npm install --save-dev linkedin-pdf-to-json
```

Local installation will only add the `lptj` command to your project's `node_modules/.bin/` directory. See the [npm docs](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#bin) for more details.

## Usage

Use the `lptj` command followed by the path to a LinkedIn profile PDF to parse it and output the JSON to the console.

Note: If linkedin-pdf-to-json is installed locally, you'll have to substitue `lptj` with the path to the `lptj` command in your project's `node_modules/.bin/` directory.

```
lptj <path to linkedin-pdf-to-json>/test/spec/profiles/IsaacMast.pdf
```

Passing the path and name of a JSON file as an additional argument will write and save the parsed JSON to the file.

```
lptj <path to linkedin-pdf-to-json>/test/spec/profiles/IsaacMast.pdf ./IsaacMast.json
```

## Testing

Run `npm test` to run the Jasmine specs.

The test suite consists of a Jasmine file in the [linkedin_pdf_to_json](./test/spec/linkedin_pdf_to_json) subdirectory that will simply compare the contents of the JSON files in the [actual](./test/spec/actual) and [expected](./test/spec/expected) subdirectories.

The *actual* directory houses the JSON files that are *actual*ly created by the parser.

The *expected* directory contains files with the same names as the files in the *actual* directory, but the contents of these files is what the parsed JSON is *expected* to be.

linkedin_pdf_to_json.sh is a bash script that will run the parser against all of the PDFs in the [profiles](./test/spec/profiles) subdirectory.

Run `./linkedin_pdf_to_json.sh -h` to see documentation on the available command line arguments.

### A Typical Test Flow

```
# Make some changes

# Alter the JSON files in test/spec/expected to reflect the expected output

# Run the bash script to update the JSON files in test/spec/actual/ and run the test suite
$ ./linkedin_pdf_to_json.sh -at
```
