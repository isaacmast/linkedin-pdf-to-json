This included a bunch of Perl and Ruby scripting to clean up and organize our corpus of recorded speech data + transcriptions in order to construct test speech models with a research group in Boulder, CO.

Challenges included reverse-engineering the protocol (and associated encryption), factoring the problem into a multi-stage filter pipeline for simplified protocol extension, creating a multi- threaded load test agent, and working with a second developer in the design of the underlying EJB structure. Incidentally, this was my first Java program. Years later, I would revisit this legacy code to help scale the server preparation for a large contract with the Army.",

At the time, XML+XSLT was hot stuff, and our writers/designers wanted to be able to craft the site using these technologies. Browser support was lacking, and Apache Cocoon was quite unstable at the time, so I ended up writing a servlet-based solution from scratch to handle managing the site content, including XML/XSLT transformation, caching, and HTML forms. This would run the main rosettastone.com site for several years until we switched to Ruby on Rails and more traditional CMS setup.",
